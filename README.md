# volatilityForecastingLSTM
Volatility forecasting using a LSTM Recursive Neural Network
Use Keras on TensorFlow with Python Scientific Libraries
Deep Learning provides non-linear function approximators
Contrast LSTM results with econometric GARCH
Volatility is unobserved
Realized Volatility calculation using Yang-Zhang Estimator
Test-first approach using sin wave for confirmation
Initial Work
